Hello All Intelligent beings!

I am just starting out but have a good idea of HTML5, CSS3, and am currently learning JS and JQuery! I am super passionate about coding as well as developing and hope to be an idiotically good ios app develeper sooner rather than later. ;) I am partial to learning as much as possible about coding and developing and would appreciate any and all good book or resource recommendations!

Thanks!
